# ADS-Clustering-and-Fitting-Poster
The purpose of the dataset is to provide a comprehensive view of the GDP of different countries and to enable analysis and comparison of the economic performance of these countries. The data can be used to identify the top performing countries in terms of GDP, to understand the distribution of GDP values and any outliers in the data, and to identify patterns and insights through clustering and visualization.
The script starts by importing the required libraries and then reads the GDP data from a CSV file using Pandas' read_csv function. The script selects only the required columns and renames them appropriately. Then, the script removes the rows with missing values, converts the GDP column data type to float, and computes some summary statistics such as mean and median GDP. the script transposes the data and sorts the data by GDP to identify the top 10 countries by GDP in 2019. 
The Python script analyzes a GDP dataset by loading, cleaning, summarizing, visualizing, clustering, and predicting the data using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The script identifies the top 10 countries by GDP, clusters the data using KMeans algorithm, and creates visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, box plots, and cluster graphs, map to provide insights into the data. The script also defines functions to predict GDP growth and plot the cluster graph using the silhouette score.
The script tests the prediction function for the United States and prints the predicted GDP growth and new GDP for the year 2021. Then, the script defines a list of years to predict GDP growth for and predicts GDP growth and new GDP for each year for the United States and China using the prediction function. Finally, the script plots the predicted GDP growth over the years for both countries.
Line chart of top 10 countries by GDP in 2019. Useful for comparing and identifying the highest performing countries in terms of GDP. Bar chart of mean GDP by cluster. Helps to understand clusters of countries based on their GDP values and compare them. Box plot of GDP distribution for all countries. Useful for identifying the range of GDP values and any outliers in the data. Line chart of predicted GDP growth for the United States and China from 2020 to 2025. Allows for comparison of predicted growth rates between the two countries. Scatter plot of country distribution in different clusters based on their GDP values. Helps to visualize clustering and identify any patterns or insights. Also,the Map provides a visual representation of the GDP by country in 2019 using different colors to Indicate varying GDP levels. It helps in identifying the countries with high and low GDP values at a glance. The poster-specific modifications such as
